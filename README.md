# Dice Roller

This is my first simple Android project in Kotlin based on [**Developing Android Apps with Kotlin**](https://eu.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012) by
**Udacity** and **Google**. Clicking on the button will update the dice image and display a Toast with the extracted number.
